# NIH_Marmoset_Atlas_v0.02
If you are an AFNI user, why bother to download the atlas from here. AFNI has already integrated the whole atlas set (via command @Install_NIH_Marmoset). 

If you are not an AFNI user, why not spend a happy afternoon to learn how to use it, a powerful neuroimaging tool created by a bunch of funny guys.~~~

If you are learning AFNI and have questions about the atlas in the AFNI, please feel free to contact me (cirong.liu@nih.gov) or Glen Daniel (glend@mail.nih.gov).
